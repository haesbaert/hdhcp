  (** [connect ?requests net] attempts to use [net] to obtain a valid
      DHCP lease containing the DHCP option codes listed in [request].
      If [request] is not specified, [connect] uses the default values
      provided by the upstream Dhcp_client implementation, which are
      a small set useful in establishing ipv4 connectivity.
      [connect] does not time out; it will terminate on send/receive
      errors or when a lease is obtained.
